<h2>Pegglenaut</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Aim for the pegs! Try to increase your score by strategically aiming your shots to accumulate a large bonus before you land in the center.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
The player should be intrigued by the unique layout and dynamics of the game. Strategy, along with a little intuition and luck, can lead to large scores. The player should be encouraged to beat their past scores and engage in subsequent plays as they gain an understanding of the dynamics through playing.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Like brick breakers, but different.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
Use the left/right arrow keys to move the cannon around the pegs. Press the spacebar to shoot the ball towards the center. Each peg is worth 100 points when knocked down. Each peg knocked down with a single ball adds a 10 point bonus to subsequent pegs that are knocked down. Green pegs add a multiplier to each peg knocked down with the current ball.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The game demonstrates the ability to use different collision groups, static bodies, "invisible" phyics bodies with null sprites, keyboard user input, and text animations with tweens.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game unique game dynamic, like a rectangular brick breaker level, wrapped around itself. More features could be implemented, like pegs that yield power ups such as your ball splits in two, gravity changes, your balls grow larger, or the pegs grow larger. Also many features could be added to additional levels, like moving pegs, and moving walls. I would also like to implement some sort of moving "bonus bin" at the center of the level, which may give an extra ball or power up if hit. You would need to time your shot well to hit the bonus bin. Objectives: Solution and Alignment.</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You have some balls. You see some pegs. What are you going to do? Knock them!!!</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
As above.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Ages 9 - 99.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
No constraints, take your shots at your leisure! What's the best angle?
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Try to hit the green pegs near the begining of your shot in order to maximize your bonus. Also try to hit as many pegs as you can in a single shot in order to maximize your bonus. Try to aim your shot at the side of a peg, so that it is deflected away from the center and begins to orbit around the center, striking pegs as it goes. This will yield larger multipliers and scores than going straight to the center.
